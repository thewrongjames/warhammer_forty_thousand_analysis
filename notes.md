# General

## Grenades vs Boltgun
* If you can throw grenades, more or less always do.
* Perhaps fire boltgun for 1 wound toughness 6 or 7.
* Frag grenade for anything with 1 wound or toughness 2 or less.
* Krak grenade anything else.

## Unit choice
* Vanguard Vets seem to be better than devastators at everything.
* But devastators still just about take out third with some loadouts.
* They will be much more durable if in cover, and charging lets your opponents
  hit back.
* Inceptors seem to be almost always worse than devastators, so presuming
  devastators can get the range, don't bother with inceptors.
* Dreadnaughts come in better than inceptors with assault cannons and missile
  launchers against 1 wound low toughness stuff, but devastators are probably
  still better all round.
* Vanguard vets, devastators and scouts, it looks like.

# Units

## Vanguard Veterans
* Two chainswords for up to W: 1 T: 4.
* Power first from there until W: 3.
* Thunder hammer anything higher.
* Maybe dual lightning claws for anything with one wound.

## Devastators
* Without any buffs:
  - Lascannon against everything with more than 4 wounds, or 2 or 3 wounds and
    toughness 8 or 9.
  - Un-overcharged plasma cannons against everything with one wound.
  - Overcharged plasma cannons against everything not taken by the other two.
  - There are a few exceptions to the above rules, but the only important one
    is at 1 wound, toughness 4, 3+ save. Overcharge against space marines.
* Captains:
  - If a captain is supporting two or more squads of devastators, they become
    more points efficient than not having them.
  - Lascannons keep the top spot against everything with more than 2 wounds
    which also has toughness 8 or 9, but overcharged plasma cannons take the
    rest or their spots.
  - Also, you are paying for the captain _so that overcharging becomes optimal_
    so _do_ overcharge.
* There are also a few spots for multi-meltas in there, but, I don't really
  think I want to be getting that close.
